    "dSGP4 is an open-source project that constitutes a differentiable version of SGP4. It also offers hybrid ML-dSGP4 models to improve the accuracy of SGP4, when simulated or observed precise data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core capabilities of dSGP4 can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Differentiable version of SGP4 (implemented in PyTorch)\n",
    "* Hybrid SGP4 and machine learning propagation: input/output/parameters corrections of SGP4 from accurate simulated or observed data are learned\n",
    "* Parallel TLE propagation\n",
    "* Use of differentiable SGP4 on several spaceflight mechanics problems (state transition matrix computation, covariance transformation, and propagation, orbit determination, ML hybrid orbit propagation, etc.)"
